There is also a bar and patrons can BTOW (Bring Their Own Wine) for a corkage charge of 20z\u0142. Cozy atmosphere & friendly English/Polish speaking staff. Until it is edited by Trip Advisor, the listing states that we are vegetarian friendly and have gluten free options. This is not strictly or literally true. We would always attempt to modify any of our dishes to suit an individual on request but for the moment the majority of the dishes do have animal products in them and many also include gluten. This will change when we expand our small kitchen and our menu.

The wines' origins, from places closely associated with viticulture, provide far from run-of-the-mill flavours. In addition, we stock interesting beers, Polish ciders and strong spirits. All the snacks and dishes served are carefully selected and prepared using the highest quality ingredients, like the board of Polish farm cheeses, characteristic Sub-Carpathian proziaki (bread muffins), ice cream from the foothills of Hodurek and traditional sausages from Lipnica Murowana. The cozy, wooden interior of the winebar is conducive to intimate meetings and events. We are keen to share the cultures of the countries that fascinate us, as well as local. We regularly organize meetings with interesting personalities, concerts by Karkow musicians and wine tastings with the winemakers we cooperate with. In addition to the wine at Lipowa 6F you can also get to know the flavours of Caucasian cuisine. All thanks to the Krako Slow Grill food truck and Pavel Portoyan! It's a dream come true for the full simplicity and taste of the Caucasus, right in the city centre. Pavel, chef and master of the grill, serves both streetfood and supper.

While today the sunset views from the amazing terraces of the restaurant/cafe represent a motion-picture-perfect romantic retreat, this site has a sinister back story. Despite resembling an ancient royal residence, this picturesque estate actually only dates back to the late-1920s when local architect and conservator Adolf Szyszko-Bohusz built the building today known as the 'Bastion' as his family residence. Seized by the Nazis at the start of the war, the estate was soon transformed into a grand residential castle for Otto Wachter - the Nazi 'Governor of the Cracow district.' [It was Wachter who established the Krakow Ghetto and organised the mass murder of Polish Jews across Galicia; he also oversaw the execution of over 1000 ethnic Poles (mostly thought to be resistance fighters) in a mass grave nearby the castle known as 'Glinik.'] The estate's imposing main mountaintop villa - then called Schloss Wartenberg ('Castle Observatory'), and today known as Przegorza\u0142y Castle - was built in 1942-43 before work was stopped upon Wachter's reassignment to Lviv; original plans for a funicular railway from the base of the mountain to the castle were never completed.After the liberation of Krakow in 1945, the Bohusz family tried unsuccessfully to reclaim the property and it became the seat of the Department of Forestry. Today Przegorza\u0142y Castle houses Jagiellonian University's Institute of European Studies, and also the Centre for Holocaust Studies. For visitors, however, the main attractions are the restaurant and cafe 'U Ziyada,' whose multi-level terraces offer jaw-dropping views of the Wis\u0142a River and the valleys below; on clear days, the peaks of the Tatras can even be seen in the distance. Undoubtedly one of the most romantic, picturesque, and intimate locations in Krakow, dinner or even just a coffee at Przegorza\u0142y is the perfect end to a trip to Las Wolski; heck, the views easily justify taking a cab straight there from your hotel (20-35z\u0142 for the about 20min ride). Bus 409 delivers students here from the 'Stadion Cracovia' stop on weekdays during the academic year, or take bus 134 from the same spot and walk 15mins down the yellow trail from its drop-off at the Zoo.", "Meals": "Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, Brunch, Drinks", "Features": "Seating, Reservations, Parking Available, Free off-street parking, Highchairs Available, Serves Alcohol, Full Bar, Wine and Beer, Accepts American Express, Accepts Mastercard, Accepts Visa, Free Wifi, Accepts Credit Cards, Table Service"}}, {"Name": "Paul's Place Restaurant & Bar", "N_reviews": "341", "Reviews_marks": {"Excellent": "279", "Very good": "45", "Average": "10", "Poor": "2", "Terrible": "5"}, "Latitude": "50.060425", "Longitude": "19.935514", "Adres": "ul.
